# Movie Hit or Flop Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a movie will be a "hit" or "flop" based on various features such as cast, director, genre, budget, runtime, language, and trailer views. By analyzing these factors, the goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively classify movies as hits or flops. This project uses Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) to optimize model hyperparameters and improve prediction accuracy.

## Project Structure
The project follows these main steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare data for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize relationships between features and the target variable (`HitOrFlop`).
3. **Modeling and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Train and tune a predictive model using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation and Insights**: Evaluate model performance and analyze the impact of different features on movie success.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is provided in CSV format and includes the following columns:

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each movie
- **Actor1**: Name of the first actor
- **Actor2**: Name of the second actor
- **Actor3**: Name of the third actor
- **Director**: Name of the director
- **Genre**: Genre of the movie
- **Budget**: Budget of the movie in currency units
- **Runtime**: Duration of the movie in minutes
- **Language**: Original language of the movie
- **LanguagesDubbedCount**: Number of languages the movie was dubbed in
- **TrailerViewCount**: Number of views on the movieâ€™s trailer
- **HitOrFlop**: Target variable (hit or flop status)

## Goals
- **Analyze** the data to understand factors that influence a movie's success.
- **Develop** a classification model to predict whether a movie will be a hit or flop.
- **Optimize** model performance using Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) to identify the best hyperparameters.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables (e.g., actors, director, genre, language), and scale numerical features as needed.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Explore relationships between features like budget, genre, and trailer views with movie success.
3. **Model Training and Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV with different classification models to find the best combination of model and hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
